# 🚀 SOLID Principles
| Principle | Description | Real-World Analogy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **S** – Single Responsibility Principle | 📌 A class should have only one reason to change, i.e., one job or responsibility. | 🧍 Like a chef who only cooks—not cleaning, not serving. |
| **O** – Open/Closed Principle | 📦 Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. | 🔌 Like a plug-and-play device—you can extend it without changing the original code. |
| **L** – Liskov Substitution Principle | 🔄 Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types without altering behavior. | 🧱 Like LEGO blocks—if one fits, another of the same type should fit too. |
| **I** – Interface Segregation Principle | 🔌 Clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on interfaces they don’t use. | 📺 Like a remote with only the buttons you need—not 50 unused ones. |
| **D** – Dependency Inversion Principle | ⬇️ High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. | 🎛️ Like using a universal power adapter—you depend on the **interface**, not the internal wiring. |
